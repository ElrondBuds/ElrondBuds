üîß Configuration
To adapt this template for your own project, you need to edit the core variables inside the <script> tag in wallet.html.

1. WalletConnect Project ID (Required)
For the xPortal QR code connection to work, you need a projectId from WalletConnect Cloud. This is free to set up.

Open wallet.html, find the ElvenJS.init call, and add your projectId.

// in wallet.html

const elvenJs = ElvenJS.init({
    // ADD YOUR ID HERE
    projectId: 'YOUR_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID',
    
    apiUrl: "https://api.multiversx.com",
    chain: "mainnet"
});

2. Target NFT Collection (For Voting Power)
To calculate voting power based on your project's NFT collection, change the ebudCollectionId variable to your collection's ticker ID.

// in wallet.html

const ebudCollectionId = "YOUR-COLLECTION-ID-abcdef";

3. Tracked ESDT Tokens
To display a specific list of fungible tokens (ESDTs), update the trackedTokens array with the token identifiers of your choice.

// in wallet.html

const trackedTokens = ["TOKEN1-abcdef", "TOKEN2-123456", "ANOTHER-TOKEN-id"];
