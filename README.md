## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is entirely client-side, so no complex setup or build process is needed.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser. For local development, a simple local server is recommended to avoid potential issues with browser security policies.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ebuds-wallet-viewer.git](https://github.com/your-username/ebuds-wallet-viewer.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd ebuds-wallet-viewer
    ```

3.  **Serve the files:**
    You can use any simple HTTP server. For example, if you have Node.js installed, you can use `http-server`:
    ```sh
    # Install http-server globally if you haven't already
    npm install -g http-server

    # Start the server
    http-server
    ```
    Or, if you have Python 3:
    ```sh
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Now, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the address provided by your server).

## üìÇ File Structure

* `wallet.html`: The main entry point of the application. Contains all the HTML structure and the core JavaScript logic.
* `styles.css`: Contains all the styling rules for the application, including the futuristic theme and responsive design.
* `assets/`: A folder to store static assets like logos and images.
